When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Most of the time, using a remote repository would be a good idea, for several 
    reasons. For example, it works well as a backup, but also it is the most
    convenient way to share our work with other people. Having a remote repository
    makes it also extremely easy to work from different computers, since we 
    would only need to clone the remote repository on the new computer to get up
    and running.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git were to stay up-to-date with the remote repository automatically, then
    it may happen that someone would commit a change to a file I am modifying, and 
    the state of the repository would become inconsistent, or it may even delete my
    changes. It makes much more sense to decide autonomously when it is the right 
    moment to pull changes to a local repository.
